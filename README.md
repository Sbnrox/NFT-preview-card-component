# Project1
It's a sample project I'm doing to get my skills up. I've been running into some trouble so I decided to ask for help. I've been having a hard time with two specific things.
1. Can you tell me if there's unnecessary or wrong code that's messing it up?
2. I've been trying to get the created by on the same line but with the last two words in white.
Everywhere I search online said it needs to have a different tag.
What do I switch it to? Or is there a way to do it in one p tag?
